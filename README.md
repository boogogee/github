# Git Hub Notes

I needed a place to put all of my notes on how to get started and use GitHub.

## Getting Started

First step it to actually install git on your machine.  For this writeup I will be using Debian/Ubuntu. Run the following command in your terminal.

`sudo apt-get install git`

You can verify that it's installed by running the following;

`which git` (shows the location of the git command)

or

`git --version` (shows the version of git installed)

END
